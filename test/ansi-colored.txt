Like most of my [1m[34mgeneration[39m[22m, [1m[2mI was brought up on the saying[1m[22m: 'Satan finds [31msome[39m
mischief for [1m[34midle hands to[39m[22m do.' [1m[31mBeing a[39m[22m highly virtuous child, I believed [31mall[39m
that I was [31mtold, and acquired[39m a conscience which has [31mkept[39m me working hard down
to the [31mpresent[39m moment. But [31malthough my conscience[39m has controlled my actions, my
opinions have undergone a revolution. I think that there is far too much work
done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is
virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is
quite different from what always has been preached. Everyone knows the story of
the traveler in Naples who saw twelve beggars lying in the sun (it was before
the d[31mays of[39m Mussolini), and o[31mffere[39md a li[31mra[39m to the l[31maziest o[39mf them. E[31mlev[39men of
them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. this traveler was on
the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine
idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be required to
inaugurate it. I hope that, after reading the following pages, the leaders of
[31mthe[39m [31mYMCA[39m [31mwill[39m [31mstart[39m [31ma[39m [31mcampaign[39m [31mto[39m in[31mduce[39m g[31mood[39m yo[31mung[39m men to do nothing. If so, I
shall not have lived in vain.
